## üìå Overview
I completed a guided course that progresses from spreadsheet fundamentals to modern Excel data modeling. The capstone deliverables are two projects:
1)  **Salary Explorer Dashboard** built with core spreadsheet skills (Units 1‚Äì4), and  
2)  **Data Jobs Analytics model** using PivotTables, **Power Query**, and **Power Pivot** (Units 5‚Äì8).

## üöÄ Consolidation Projects

### Project A ‚Äî **Salary Explorer Dashboard** (Units 1‚Äì4)
An interactive spreadsheet dashboard for **data jobs** that reports:
- **Median salary** by *Job Title*, *Country*, and *Employment Type*  
- **Job count** by title/country  
- **Top job platforms/boards**  
- Cross-filtering via slicers and clean, presentation-ready charts

**Skills used:** structured tables, robust formulas, dynamic ranges, chart design, slicers

### Project B ‚Äî **Data Jobs Analytics (PQ + PP)** (Units 5‚Äì8)
A model-driven workbook using **Power Query** to clean/shape the data and **Power Pivot** to deliver repeatable, governed analysis:
- **ETL**: remove duplicates/nulls, standardize categories (titles, countries, employment types), derive date columns  
- **Model**: star schema with Facts (Jobs) and Dimensions (Date, Geo, Role, Platform)  
- **DAX**: measures for `Median Salary`, `Job Count`, `% Mix by Employment Type`, `Top N Titles`, YoY deltas  
- **PivotTables/PivotCharts** with slicers/timelines for executives and recruiters

**Outcome:** A maintainable analytics workbook that refreshes from source files and supports consistent, auditable reporting.
